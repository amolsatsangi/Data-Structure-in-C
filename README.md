# Data Structures in C

This repository contains implementations of fundamental data structures and their basic operations in C. The goal of this repository is to provide a clear and concise understanding of how different data structures are implemented and operated upon using the C programming language.

## Overview

The following data structures are covered:

- **Arrays**: Static and dynamic arrays with basic operations like insertion, deletion, searching, and traversal.
- **Linked Lists**: Singly and doubly linked lists with operations like insertion, deletion, and reversal.
- **Trees**: Binary trees, binary search trees (BST), and basic traversal techniques (inorder, preorder, postorder).

## Repository Structure

Each data structure is contained within its own directory, and the source code for basic operations is provided for each.


## How to Compile and Run

To compile and run any of the programs:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amolsatsangi/Data-Structure-in-C.git
cd Data-Structure-in-C
```
2. Navigate to the specific directory for the data structure you're interested in.
3. Use a C compiler like gcc to compile the .c files. For example:

```bash
gcc -o array_operations Arrays/array_operations.c
./array_operations
```

## Features

- Clean and well-commented code for easy understanding.
- Standard data structure operations implemented using the C programming language.
- Suitable for students, beginners, and anyone looking to understand data structures from a low-level programming perspective.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you want to improve the existing code, add more data structures, or suggest optimizations, feel free to fork this repository and submit a pull request.
